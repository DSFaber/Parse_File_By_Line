# Parse_File_By_Line
This script looks for a dated file and specific filename, then parses it line-by-line looking for a blank character position in the row. When the blank field is not found, it saves the row to a new file (Type1) and different folder. When it does find the value in the row it saves the value into a different file/folder (Type2).
